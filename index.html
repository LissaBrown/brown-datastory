<h2>Throughout This Semester</h2>
<p>Throughout this semester, I have taken a hard look at my habits within social media.
I first kept track of the times I used social media in class, and what was either prompting or
encouraging that. Then, I looked specifically at Pinterest and some of the privacy regulations
the site has in place. The following visualizations and information address some of that! </p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>

<section class="data">


<img src="assets/img/Screenshot.png" class="datacollection" alt="Do not forget me!"/>

<p>The screenshot shows my data collection of the times I used social media in class. Specifically,
it shows the classes in which I was on social media instead of taking notes. It also shows the class
activity that was ongoing while I was on social media instead of fully participating.</p>

  <h2>Data Visualization</h2>

    <div class="centering-container">
      <p> My data visualization shows a representation
        of each day that I tracked my social media use.
        Each icon represents a different social media output,
        and the colors represent the class it was used.</p>

  <p>This video explores the privacy policies that Pinterest holds and makes
    clear on their website. It also defines some of the terms used in the
    policies to make clearer exactly what is being done with user data.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In closing, throughout this semester I have learned that
    not only do I turn to social media all too easily when my
    attention should be on other things, but my activity is being
    tracked moreso than I may be aware of. Though Pinterest deletes
    their collected data, some other entities are not as conservative
    with thier use of user data.</p>
